# Stock Price Prediction with LSTM

This project demonstrates how to predict stock prices using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network in a Jupyter Notebook. We use historical stock price data for Apple Inc. (AAPL) as an example. The LSTM model is implemented with TensorFlow and scikit-learn libraries.

Introduction
Predicting stock prices is a challenging and complex task. This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates the basic process of predicting stock prices using LSTM, including data preprocessing, model creation, training, and evaluation.

Installation
Before running the Jupyter Notebook, you need to install the required libraries. You can do this using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow
The Jupyter Notebook itself can be run in your local Jupyter environment.

Usage
Download the historical stock price data for the company you want to predict and save it as a CSV file in the same directory as the Jupyter Notebook. In the provided example, the file is named 'AAPL.csv.'

Open the Jupyter Notebook and execute each cell in order. The notebook covers the following steps:

Loading and visualizing historical stock price data.
Data preprocessing, including normalization.
Creating sequences for the LSTM model.
Building, compiling, and training the LSTM model.
Making predictions and evaluating the model.
Observe the results and adjust the model or parameters as needed.

Results
After running the Jupyter Notebook, you should see the following results:

Visualizations of historical and predicted stock prices.
The Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) as an evaluation metric for the model.
Please note that this is a simplified example for educational purposes, and real-world stock price prediction requires more data and factors.
